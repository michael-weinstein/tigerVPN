# tigerVPN
tigerVPN connection manager

This requires openvpn to already be installed and the user to be running with admin rights (sudo).
To use this, move the config folder with all the different server configurations to the same folder as
this program and launch in python3.

The first time you run, it will ask if you want to store your credentials.  They will be kept in the same folder
as this program, but will not be encrypted in any way (though they will have restricted read permissions).
